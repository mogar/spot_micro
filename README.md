# Spot Micro Experiments

* docker-full: a ROS2 dockerfile for use on an RPi4
* spot_ws: a ROS2 workspace containing all custom packages to control a Spot Micro

## Robot Hardware

Originally designed based off of the [Spot Micro NovaSM3](https://novaspotmicro.com/). The electronics have mostly been replaced with just an RPi4.

## Usage

* Set up the RPi 4, install docker on it, build the docker image from `docker-full`
* start the docker container and get a shell on it (see instructions in `docker-full` README)
* within docker, run the following

```
cd /home/ros/spot_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

## TODO:

* update joylistener to make it custom for joy2servodebug
